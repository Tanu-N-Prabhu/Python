        "[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) is an amazing tool that lets us build and execute an outstanding data science model and provides us with an opportunity to document our journey. As Google Colab provides us **code cells** to type the code, it also provides us with text cells to add the text. In this tutorial, we will focus more on the **text cell** and see how we can master it by using some simple commands that I will discuss in this tutorial. If you love documenting (like me) then you will enjoy reading this tutorial. You can start exploring Google Colab from below given link. Believe me, it’s an amazing tool.\n",
