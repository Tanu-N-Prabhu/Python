# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Goal
Understand the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and how it is applied to solve real-world problems.

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

In traditional programming:
- You give the computer rules + data → it produces answers.
In ML:
- You give the computer data + answers → it learns rules.

## Key Types of Machine Learning

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
The model learns from labeled data (input features + correct output).
- **Examples:** Predicting house prices, classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
The model learns patterns from unlabeled data (only input features, no known output).
- **Examples:** Customer segmentation, topic modeling.
- **Algorithms:** K-Means Clustering, PCA.

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
- **Examples:** Game playing AI, robot navigation.

## Common Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Problem Definition** – What do we want to predict or discover?
2. **Data Collection** – Gather relevant data.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean, transform, and prepare data.
4. **Model Selection** – Choose the appropriate algorithm.
5. **Training** – Teach the model using training data.
6. **Evaluation** – Test the model's performance using test data.
7. **Deployment** – Put the model into production for real use.

## Tools for Machine Learning
- **Python Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Environments:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
