# Level 5: Bonus Mastery

_Go Beyond_

## Goal
The aim of Level 5 is to **deepen your expertise** in specialized skills that elevate you from a proficient analyst to a highly adaptable data professional. This stage goes beyond the core and introduces you to advanced tools, techniques, and workflows used in real-world, high-impact projects.

## Topics to Explore

### 1. [SQL for Analysts](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%205/sql_for_analysts.ipynb)
- Learn how to query, filter, group, and aggregate large datasets stored in relational databases.
- Focus on SQL patterns useful for analysis: `JOIN`s, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.

### 2. [Excel Power Tools](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%205/excel_power_tools.md)
- Use Excel's advanced features such as PivotTables, Power Query, and formulas for powerful, quick analysis.
- Learn integration workflows between Excel and Python for automation.

### 3. [Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%205/time_series_analysis.ipynb)
- Understand trends, seasonality, and forecasting in time-dependent data.
- Learn basic forecasting models using Python’s built-in libraries without heavy dependencies.

### 4. [A/B Testing and Experiments](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%205/a_b_testing_%26_experiments.ipynb)
- Design experiments to compare groups, test hypotheses, and measure statistical significance.
- Learn how to interpret p-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes.

### 5. [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%205/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning.md)
- Explore supervised and unsupervised learning basics.
- Understand model training, evaluation, and prediction for beginner ML workflows.

### 6. [Reporting Automation (Python + Excel)](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Level%205/reporting_automation_with_python.ipynb)
- Automate the creation of recurring reports using Python scripts.
- Save reports in Excel or other formats for quick distribution.

### 7. Cloud Tools (Google Sheets, BigQuery, etc.)
- Learn to connect your analysis workflows to cloud-hosted data.
- Use APIs and connectors to work with live, collaborative datasets.

---

## Tools
- **SQL Databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, BigQuery)
- **Excel** (with Power Query & PivotTables)
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels
- **Cloud Tools**: Google Sheets API, BigQuery
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive exploration

---

## Expected Output
By completing Level 5, you will:
- Be able to query and analyze complex datasets directly from databases.
- Automate reporting workflows for efficiency.
- Build and interpret statistical and machine learning models.
- Use cloud-based platforms for collaborative data work.
- Confidently handle advanced data analysis scenarios across domains.

---

## Suggested Workflow
1. **Learn each skill individually** with small projects.
2. **Combine multiple skills** into a single integrated project (e.g., query data in BigQuery, run an A/B test, visualize results, and publish a report).
3. **Automate & Share** – Publish your notebooks, dashboards, or reports to GitHub or cloud tools for easy collaboration.
