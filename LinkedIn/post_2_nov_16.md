### Introduction 
Data science is not only about coding. It begins with asking the right question that guides the entire analysis.  

### Problem Statement
Many teams collect data without a clear goal. This leads to confusion, slow progress, and weak results  

### Solution
Start by asking a simple question that your data can answer. Then use small steps to explore patterns, test ideas, and confirm the insight.  

### Code  
```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.DataFrame({'Score':[50,70,90]})
print(data.mean())
```
> **Alt Text:** This code creates a small data table with three score values, then calculates the average score using the mean function and prints the result.

### Conclusion
Strong questions lead to strong insights. Focus on clarity, and your data work becomes easier and more meaningful
