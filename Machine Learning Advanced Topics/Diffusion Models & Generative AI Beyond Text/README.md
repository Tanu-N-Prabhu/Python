# Diffusion Models & Generative AI Beyond Text
_Educational Demo_

This repository contains a **simple, lightweight** Google Colab notebook to introduce the core concepts behind diffusion-based generative AI, including:

## Topics Covered
- **Stable Diffusion architecture**
- **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**
- **Text-to-Image & Text-to-Video**
- **ControlNet for guided generation**

## What's Inside
- A **tiny pre-trained diffusion model** (`google/ddpm-cifar10-32`) for fast execution
- Step-by-step code with explanations
- Runs on CPU or GPU in Colab

## Disclaimer
This is a **Tier 1** educational demo; the generated outputs are **not** high quality or realistic.  
It is intended **purely for learning purposes**.
