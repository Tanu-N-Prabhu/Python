# Logistic Regression from Scratch (No ML Libraries)

This notebook demonstrates how to implement **Logistic Regression** step-by-step using **NumPy only** — no machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

It's designed for students and beginners to clearly understand the math, code, and reasoning behind logistic regression, especially for **interview preparation**.

## What You’ll Learn

- The concept of binary classification
- The sigmoid function and decision boundaries
- Binary cross-entropy loss
- How gradient descent updates weights and bias
- How to evaluate a model using accuracy
- How to visualize a decision boundary (2D data)
