# Python Learning Track

This directory contains a structured, curriculum-style Python learning path, designed to take learners from core fundamentals to advanced language concepts in a clear, progressive manner.

The focus here is Python as a language, not Data Science, not libraries, and not external domains.

## Purpose of This Section

- Build **strong Python fundamentals**
- Maintain **clear conceptual boundaries**
- Provide **hands-on practice + theory**
- Serve as a **reference-quality Python guide**

If you are new to Python or revisiting fundamentals, this folder is the **recommended starting point**.

## Learning Recommendation

For best results, follow the folders in **numeric order**

> Each section builds on the previous one.

## What This Folder Does NOT Contain

To keep learning clear and focused, this folder intentionally **does not include**:

- Pandas or NumPy
- Data Science or Machine Learning
- External APIs or data sources

Those topics live in separate **top-level directories**.

## Contributions

Improvements are welcome, especially:

- Clearer explanations
- Better examples
- Additional quizzes
- Structural improvements

Please follow the repository’s **CONTRIBUTING.md** guidelines.

## Final Note

This Python section is designed to be:

- Beginner-friendly
- Interview-relevant
- Long-term maintainable

It prioritizes **clarity over cleverness and structure over volume.**
