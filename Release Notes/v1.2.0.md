### Bug Fixes

**Fixed GitHub Notebook Rendering Error (`metadata.widgets` issue)**  
A user reported that [2](https://github.com/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/tree/e36bbc040e00c80c04418aeb5e6543a5d8948487/Machine%20Learning%20Advanced%20Topics) of the Jupyter Notebooks failed to render on GitHub with the following message:

> *“There was an error rendering your Notebook: the 'state' key is missing from 'metadata.widgets'. Add 'state' to each, or remove 'metadata.widgets'.”*

**Cause:**  
Google Colab automatically injects a `metadata.widgets` block into `.ipynb` files.  
GitHub’s notebook renderer does not support this widget metadata, leading to a rendering failure.

**Resolution:**  
The invalid widget metadata was manually removed from the affected notebook.

**Steps performed:**  
1. Opened the `.ipynb` file in **VS Code** as raw JSON  
   *(Right-click → **Reopen Editor With** → **Text Editor**)*
2. Searched for all occurrences of `"widgets"` inside the metadata.
3. Deleted the **entire `"widgets"` block**, including all nested content and its trailing comma.
4. Saved the file and reopened it in Notebook mode.
5. Committed and pushed the cleaned notebook back to GitHub.

**Result:**  
The notebook now renders correctly on GitHub with no errors.
