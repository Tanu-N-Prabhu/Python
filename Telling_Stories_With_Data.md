## Introduction
Do you drink coffee every day? I do 6-7 times a day. Coffee’s for closers, right! Every time I go to a coffee store (Tim Hortons, both here in Calgary and Bengaluru), I always ask myself these 3 things:

- Which day is the busiest?
- When do pastries sell more on weekends or weekdays?
- What day of the week generates the highest revenue?

The store manager can obviously answer this, but he does not remember it off the top of his head. He refers to something called a dataset. This is where all the answers to my questions lie. Let’s take a tour of exploring a made-up dataset and understanding the art of storytelling.
