## Introduction
Do you drink coffee every day? I do 6-7 times a day. Coffee’s for closers, right! Every time I go to a coffee store (Tim Hortons, both here in Calgary and Bengaluru), I always ask myself these 3 things:

- Which day is the busiest?
- When do pastries sell more on weekends or weekdays?
- What day of the week generates the highest revenue?

The store manager can obviously answer this, but he does not remember it off the top of his head. He refers to something called a dataset. This is where all the answers to my questions lie. Let’s take a tour of exploring a made-up dataset and understanding the art of storytelling.

## Dataset
Here’s a small Coffee Shop Sales dataset we’ll analyze:

Like I said earlier, this is a simple dataset that comprises basic information that one can access for free.

## Generating the dataset
We only need to import the pandas library to perform basic exploration and generate the dataset. Here is how we can do it.

```python
# Importing Necessary Library
import pandas as pd

# Coffee Shop Sales dataset
data = {
    "Date": ["2025-08-01", "2025-08-02", "2025-08-03", "2025-08-04", "2025-08-05", "2025-08-06", "2025-08-07"],
    "Day": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"],
    "Coffee Sold": [120, 95, 110, 105, 130, 85, 90],
    "Pastries Sold": [45, 38, 50, 42, 55, 70, 65],
    "Revenue ($)": [860, 720, 800, 770, 940, 780, 760]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df
```
