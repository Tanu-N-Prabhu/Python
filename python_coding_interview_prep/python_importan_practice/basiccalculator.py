"""
Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().



Example 1:

Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
s represents a valid expression.
'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        stack = []
        num = 0
        sign = 1
        result = 0

        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                num = num * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == "+":

                result += stack.pop()  # Pop the preceding result.

        result += sign * num
        return result

solution = Solution()
s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
result = solution.calculate(s)
print(result)  # Output: 23
